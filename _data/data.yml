career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     My research interests revolve around bridging the gap between Computer Science and Biology. After graduating from university,
     I began working in a Neuroscience lab. I soon took over most of the lab's data processing duties and quickly discovered the
     massive, untapped potential in applying computational techniques in the realm of biomedical research. I, therefore, completed
     a Data Science master's program and am currently studying Computational Neuroscience as a PhD student. My current research
     involves developing models to udnerstand the role of consequence in reward-driven decision-making.

      company: SRI International, Menlo Park
      details: |
        I worked full-time in the Sleep Neurobiology Lab at SRI International for 2.5 years. I worked on both
        commercial and academic projects and my duties included: genotyping, dosing, stereotactic surgery,
        EEG/EMG recording, manual & automated sleep scoring, data processing (MATLAB & Python) and report
        writing. I served as a Project Leader for several pharmaco-EEG projects and I continue to process
        data for the lab today as a remote, hourly employee. 
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2020-2021
      company: University of Barcelona
      details: |
        I'm currently working on a project entitled "Quantifying Consequence in Reward-Driven Decision Making: A Machine Learning & Dynamical Systems
        Approach". The overall goal of the project is to characterize the relationship between consequence and decision making in both humans and NHPs.
        The neural component of the project involves ML-based analyses of EEG & LFP during the execution of a novel task. The behavioral component
        involves analyses of kinematics as well as desigining and fitting reinforcement learning models.
